      <p>Whenever I talk about Functional Programming people with experience in web make faces. And seriously don't blame them. </p>

<p>Issue is mainly Functional Programming stays in back ground only. If you see any starting example of any functional language is mainly some machine learning example or some complicated algorithm example. And that may effect normal people to getting started with Functional Programming. </p>

<p>But functional programming can do far more than that. And that include simple things too. And I means it can make thing simpler or I can say it can make easy thing simple. </p>

<p>Here, if I say have to put web case here. May be web is right now most appropriate place where functional programming can be used. And reason is damn simple, current web projects are getting bigger and bigger and user base is also getting even larger. Now, to support that hardware is also getting better and better.

      <p>Now a days I am little bit more involved in History lessons. And those also from Computer Science only. Specifically from programming language's perspective.  Why on the earth I am doing this, I guess answer is given by  <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Duglas Cockford</a> over the <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Hanselminutes</a>.  And personally I love this part of learning. It is so delightful to know different language and why languages emerge the way it is.</p>

<p>That is one part of story. Now, I was talking with my friend about different ways of rapid game development, as we both like playing and making games. (Nothing reached to the release level yet though :P). It is fun always. Now, he is working with C++ and I am .Net guy until now. Recently I become web guy on paper with Java Script skills again on paper :P. But as I mentioned I have special love for languages.

      <p>I am not kind of Technical person who started hacking / coding in very early age. But I have special love / affection towards numbers. I don't know why but it always fascinate me.</p>

<p>And this was the starting point or I can say reason I started baby steps in functional programming. I like DI, not in term of Dependency Injection but in case of Data Interpretation. Those tabular data and all the graphs and details that data can produce is awesome. It simply blow away my mind. </p>

<p>It is possible to do analysis in almost any language, but as I have heard it will be fairly easy with functional languages. As, I was coming from .Net background (Its just I am / was using as my day job.) I checked out F#.

      <p>Because it is good. It is fun to write code in functional language. It takes away unnecessary complexity from my way. It do as problem needed I don't need to act as computer to give instruction to computer for how to do computing.

        <span>posted on 27 Aug 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you ever involved in web development, then you must be knowing the history of it. Once upon a time there is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_script">CGI</a>. And at that moment there are static html pages. </p>

<p>Only few part of page is dynamic. Then things changed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_server_pages">ASP</a> came. Server access become so normal and easy. But still there is a lot more work to do. And main issue with them is code is not arranged and coding style is not suitable for big projects. </p>

<p>One can create dirty few pages but creating sophisticated big project is almost big no no. Same is true with other part of languages too. Languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">Php</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Server_Pages">JSP</a> etc.</p>

<p>At that moment, something called <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> took birth. It was extracted from <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. And then it took the world like anything. Even today it is so popular. </p>

<p>I am proper Microsoft Developer. And I know Asp.Net MVC(at least my <a href="http://kunjan.in/pages/resume">Resume</a> says so.). I never felt I should learn any other thing than MVC. It is good, better than Web Forms (at least for me). And I know how to do data in and data out.

      <p>I want confess that, my whole career I was and I am working with Visual Studio. Not a big fan, but it was good or I must say it is good. I don't think any other IDE is doing as much thing as visual studio is doing. </p>

<p>And with few add-ons (even if you exclude <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>) it is like wow. As full time web developer I like the tools, that always there to solve my issue. </p>

<p>But my love for languages like C# is far more than that. Give me my language and I can do wonders. And I also love OSS work and people doing OSS work in .net. One of my favourite project is <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a>.</p>

<p>Now, here is the point, when a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot">Demis</a>, creator of  <a href="http://servicestack.net/">Servicestack</a> made me thinking. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Am I going to far with my affection for tools? Am I doing it <em>wrong</em>? Am I going in <em>wrong</em> direction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://twitter.com/kunjee/status/344894343066296321">twitter conversation</a>. And I agreed if I don' learn new things I am not doing justification to my old tools. How can I say that Visual Studio is good if I haven't tried <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublimetext</a> or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>.

      <p>It have been long that I was doing active blogging. There are multiple reason for that, and on of them is being a lazy ass. </p>

<p>I changed my blog from <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net">Orchard</a> to <a href="http://docpad.org/">Docpad</a> for almost no reason. I just wanted my few page look different then other pages. And that will little bit more effort if I am going to do it with <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net">Orchard</a>.  So, I check out on net how to do it. I know Rob was using <a href="http://nestacms.com/">Nesta</a> but I am not good with Ruby, at least that much and more over ruby was giving issue on my windows machine. And switching on my VM just to write blog... Naaaahhh!!!!</p>

<p>Then I moved to Docpad. I have to loose some of my comments, which was there as part of Orchard system. But it was fine. Only painful thing is I have to do lot more work to just get it up as I wanted. It was not like set up and go using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials">Windows Essentials' Live Writer</a>. But it is giving me flexibility. </p>

<p>And in other reason, work load at day job. Things are moving faster then I can plan for. I was trying to learn other languages and tools. Moving out of my comfort zone. So, number of posts are less. Sadly!!!</p>

<p>I also changed my job and my city, so that transaction do take time, specially leaving city like Bangalore was a bit of a pain on my side. Now, I am out shock, almost!

      <p>I have recently moved my blog to docpad. Reason, I want to move to heroku and I want static files to be hosted.</p>

<p>I do have checked out project like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">octapress</a>. They are good but ruby was giving me issue on my windows machine with no reason. And in any case I am better with JavaScript then what I can do with ruby. </p>

<p>And also <a href="http://docpad.org/">docpad</a> is having wonderful plugins system and easy to start skeleton. I was able to get up and started in just no time. </p>

<p>I was hosting my blog with <a href="http://www.orchardproject.net/">Orchard</a> a wonderful .net CMS system. But the thing is it very big for my need. And to edit them I have to write lot more code just to move few parts here and there</p>

<p><a href="http://docpad.org/">docpad</a> on other hand make it very easy to move things as at the end it is just a static html files. So, if I like give somewhat different touch to my any specific page I can give them specifically. I don't need to change complete theme for that. Which is there in other kinda blog engines. </p>

        <span>posted on 05 Dec 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>If you have read my previous articles you must be knowing that I don’t like ORMs that much and also I am pretty lazy person. I don’t like to repeat stuff again and again. If I can find the solution than I will automate it or I just change from very root. Same thing is true with Entity Framework. It comes after LINQ to SQL as an improved ORM. And it proved to be lousy. But here is the catch if we are not using it with all its functionality it is lousy.</p>

<p>Now, it provides proper name at entity level and also inheritance like stuff. Its really a cool and neat feature about Entity Framework to abstract away the complexity of database with ‘_’ name. I never understand this type of names and I don’t know if ever I will be understanding this type of name. But if you are just updating from database and using it, than there is no use of EF at all. Or there is no need of EF. If I will become little bit harsh, then I can say <strong>“WE ARE DOING IT WRONG”</strong> .</p>

<p>And after EF evolved to further version it is providing more features, but still we are stick to the feature which is shown in <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> . We must understand here that there is difference between demo and production. In demo we have pizza factory in production we never have at least in most of the cases. So, things are far different in production environment. If we are just deleting and adding entities then obviously again <strong>“WE ARE DOING IT WRONG”</strong> . If any one think who the hell I am to tell that ??? I am just nothing and no one, but I am open minded to ideas and new things. Just think how much more overhead you are having for pushing EF in production. It is there to help you out not to make things worst.

        <span>posted on 02 Nov 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>I am particularly a lazy guy. I don’t work hard, stay back and never show sad face to issue or bug. Obviously many don’t like me for this. But again “who cares?”. But one thing is sure for me, I always ready to learn new things and obviously always work for better code. At the end of day it is just a code, bugs will be there and me too , to solve the issue.</p>

<p>Here, I mentions new things, but in reality it is not possible all the time that I will get new things. Some time I will get old things to take care off. Or something that never changed. I was reading old articles from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Hanselman</a> , now a days he is putting more preference over high quality article. So, his articles are not coming daily basis. So, one day I was wondering towards the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GreatestHits.aspx">hit series of articles</a> and I found “ <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SomeGuidingPrinciplesForSoftwareDevelopment.aspx">some guiding principles for software development</a> ”. And again as per suggestion again from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Hanselman</a> I <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstapaperDeliveredToYourKindleChangesHowYouConsumeWebContentPlusIFTTTBlogsAndMore.aspx">read later</a> it.</p>

<p>Now, I was working on something and just to get refreshed I was checking my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> and found this one. I was reading it. First thing I noticed is that it was written in 2007; even before I was a certified software engineer. As, I normally don’t read historical article that much but I read this. And that surprised me!!! Nothing is changed at all. Principles are same even after 5 years of this articles. And when they written it was there only. And also one thing is not changed too, we are not following most of them… (saying from the personal experience). For a change now a days I tried to follow them…</p>
