Perfect. Below is **one single, long, copy-pasteable message** you can feed directly into **Cursor** (or any coding agent).
It’s written as a **clear intent + constraints + content direction** prompt, aligned with **everything we discussed**, and anchored on the **felipecordero.com–style structure**, without copying it.

No fluff. No marketing cringe. No AI voice.
This is a **90-degree pivot**, not a 180.

### 📌 CURSOR PROMPT (COPY-PASTE AS IS)

I am rebuilding my personal site **kunjan.in** for 2026.
This is a **strategic repositioning**, not a cosmetic redesign.

## High-level goal

Transform the site from a developer blog / learning journal into a **personal consulting + authority site**, while preserving my **human, sarcastic, playful writing voice**.
This site should justify **premium consulting rates** without becoming corporate, generic, or “LinkedIn-thought-leader” styled.

## Reference structure (NOT visual copy)

Use **[https://www.felipecordero.com/](https://www.felipecordero.com/)** as a *structural inspiration only*:

* clear hero statement
* services / offerings early
* writing is secondary, curated
* personal, confident, calm
* not blog-first
* not agency-style
* not academic

We will change colors, spacing, typography choices, and copy so it does NOT look copied.

## Theme / Stack

* Hugo site
* Multi-page (NOT one-page)
* Clean, fast, minimal
* Easy to maintain
* Content-driven, not animation-driven

## Tone & Voice (CRITICAL)

* Keep my **natural tone**: witty, sarcastic, pragmatic, builder-first
* Humor is allowed and encouraged, but:

  * clarity first, jokes second
  * humor should signal confidence, not unseriousness
* Avoid:

  * marketing jargon
  * hype words
  * “transform your business” language
  * AI-generated generic phrasing
* AI can help with grammar and structure only — **not voice**

## Audience

* Founders
* CTOs
* Operators
* People who care about:

  * cost
  * reliability
  * long-term maintainability
  * real production systems
* Not juniors, not tutorial seekers, not price shoppers

## Core positioning (implicit, not shouted)

* I build and design **systems that run in production**
* I care about **cost, failure modes, and boring reliability**
* I’ve shipped, broken, paid for, fixed, and lived with systems
* Architecture through experience, not theory
* AI is a tool, not magic
* Free tiers, penny-scale infra, pragmatic trade-offs matter

## Site structure (REQUIRED)

### 1. Home

Hero section:

* One strong positioning statement (architect / system builder / consultant)
* Sub-statement describing focus areas:

  * Architecture
  * AI integration (incl. RAG)
  * Full-stack systems
  * LegalTech / Healthcare / complex domains
* Clear CTAs:

  * “Work with me”
  * “Writing”
  * “Book a session” (Topmate)

Sections below hero:

* What I do (services, outcome-focused)
* How I work (process, responsibility, ownership)
* Selected writing (3–5 curated essays only, not latest posts)
* Short personal blurb (human, not resume)
* Call to action

### 2. Services / Work With Me

Explain clearly:

* Consulting & architecture
* Full-stack delivery
* AI & RAG integration
* System reviews
* Long-term partnerships

Include:

* How engagements work
* What problems I’m a good fit for
* What I’m NOT a good fit for
* Pricing philosophy (not exact rates, but premium positioning)
* Link to Topmate for paid calls / sessions

### 3. Writing

Rename “Blog” to **Writing** or **Essays**.

Writing principles:

* Long-form
* Opinionated
* Experience-driven
* Evergreen
* Architecture, trade-offs, decisions, mistakes, scars
* Humor allowed

Structure writing by **themes**, not chronology:

* Architecture
* AI & RAG Systems
* Systems That Run in Production
* Cost, Scale & Reliability
* LegalTech / Healthcare patterns
* Tech leadership & decisions

Do NOT show “latest posts” prominently.
Do NOT show dates aggressively.
This is a **library of thinking**, not a feed.

### 4. About

Tell my story as:

* Builder → architect → operator → consultant
* Curious, playful, but responsible
* Emphasize:

  * longevity
  * learning through building
  * running real systems
  * caring about consequences

Avoid resume dump.
Avoid buzzwords.
Avoid hype.

### 5. Contact / Book

* Email contact
* Topmate integration (paid sessions / consulting calls)
* Clear expectation setting:

  * serious inquiries only
  * not free consulting
  * respect time

## Content migration rules

* Existing blogs stay, but:

  * re-categorized
  * reframed if needed
  * some promoted to “Selected Writing”
* Short / exploratory posts are de-emphasized
* No pressure to post frequently
* Quality > quantity

## Visual direction

* Clean, modern
* Strong typography
* Generous whitespace
* Calm colors (NOT loud)
* Images allowed in writing:

  * purposeful
  * illustrative
  * humorous when appropriate
  * not stock-y or decorative

## What NOT to do

* Do NOT turn this into a marketing site
* Do NOT remove personality
* Do NOT sound like an agency
* Do NOT optimize for SEO first
* Do NOT make it blog-centric
* Do NOT flatten voice with AI tone

## Success criteria

When someone lands on kunjan.in, they should think:
“This person has built real things, understands trade-offs, has opinions, and would be expensive — but worth it.”

### End of prompt

---

If you want, next we can:

* Write the **exact homepage hero copy**
* Draft the **Services page text**
* Select **which old posts become “Selected Writing”**
* Write a **Topmate positioning blurb**
* Or do a **site map + content checklist**

But this prompt alone is strong enough to get Cursor to start moving in the **right direction immediately**.

This is a good way to start 2026.
