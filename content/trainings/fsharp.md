## Duration 

It is a 2 Days intensive hands-on workshop focused on functional programming concepts using F# and practical application development.

## Overview

Ready to explore the world of functional programming? This workshop introduces you to functional programming concepts through F#, a practical functional-first language on the .NET platform. Led by an industry veteran with 17+ years of development experience, you'll learn how functional programming patterns can lead to more maintainable and reliable code.

No theoretical fluff - just practical approaches that demonstrate the power of functional programming in real-world scenarios. By the end of this training, you'll understand not just the "how" but the crucial "why" behind functional programming patterns.

## What You'll Learn

1. Functional Programming Fundamentals
    - Immutability and pure functions
    - Higher-order functions
    - Function composition
    - Pattern matching
    - Type inference and type safety

2. F# Language Essentials
    - F# Interactive and development environment
    - Records and Discriminated Unions
    - Collections and sequence operations
    - Computation expressions
    - Active patterns

3. Railway Oriented Programming
    - Understanding the Result type
    - Error handling patterns
    - Chaining operations
    - Validation workflows
    - Composing error handlers

4. Domain Modeling
    - Types as documentation
    - Making invalid states unrepresentable
    - Algebraic data types
    - Property-based testing
    - Domain-driven design in F#

5. SAFE Stack Introduction
    - Setting up SAFE Stack
    - Fable for F# to JavaScript compilation
    - Saturn for web development
    - Elmish architecture
    - Full-stack F# development

6. Practical Applications
    - Building a REST API
    - Handling JSON serialization
    - Database access with F#
    - Async programming patterns
    - Testing strategies
