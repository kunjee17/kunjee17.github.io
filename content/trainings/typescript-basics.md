## Duration 

It is a 2 Days hands-on workshop. It would be minimum PPT and maximum real-world coding.

## Overview

This workshop is designed for JavaScript developers who want to level up their development skills with TypeScript - taught by someone with extensive experience in both JavaScript and TypeScript development. You'll learn how to leverage TypeScript's powerful type system to write more reliable and maintainable code, backed by real-world examples and best practices.

By the end of this training, you'll be confident in writing type-safe applications and understanding TypeScript's core features that make it an essential tool in modern web development.
