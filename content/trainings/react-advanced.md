## Duration 

It is a 2 Days intensive hands-on workshop focused on advanced React patterns and performance optimization.

## Overview

Ready to take your React skills to the next level? This workshop is designed for developers who are already comfortable with React basics and want to dive deep into advanced patterns, state management, and performance optimization. Led by an industry veteran with 17+ years of web development experience who has been working with React since its inception, you'll learn production-tested patterns that solve real-world challenges.

No theoretical fluff - just battle-tested approaches that we use in production applications every day. By the end of this training, you'll understand not just the "how" but the crucial "why" behind advanced React patterns and performance optimization techniques.

## What You'll Learn

1. Advanced State Management
    - Complex state handling with useReducer
    - Global state management with Context API
    - Modern state management solutions (Zustand, Jotai)
    - When to use different state management approaches

2. Custom Hooks
    - Building reusable custom hooks
    - Best practices and common patterns
    - Real-world custom hook examples
    - Testing custom hooks

3. Performance Optimization
    - Deep dive into React's rendering behavior
    - Strategic use of useMemo and useCallback
    - React.memo and when to use it
    - Code splitting and lazy loading
    - Bundle size optimization

4. Server State Management
    - TanStack React Query fundamentals
    - Caching and invalidation strategies
    - Optimistic updates
    - Error handling patterns

5. Error Handling
    - Implementing Error Boundaries
    - Global error handling strategies
    - Error reporting best practices
    - Recovery patterns

6. Testing
    - Unit testing React components
    - Testing hooks and custom logic
    - Integration testing with React Testing Library
    - End-to-end testing with Cypress
    - Test-driven development approaches
