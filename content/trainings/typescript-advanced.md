## Duration 

It is a 2 Days intensive hands-on workshop focused on advanced TypeScript patterns and type system mastery.

## Overview

Ready to master TypeScript's powerful type system? This workshop is designed for developers who are comfortable with TypeScript basics and want to dive deep into advanced types, patterns, and performance optimization. Led by an industry veteran with 17+ years of web development experience, you'll learn production-tested patterns that solve real-world typing challenges.

No theoretical fluff - just battle-tested approaches that we use in production applications every day. By the end of this training, you'll understand not just the "how" but the crucial "why" behind advanced TypeScript patterns and type system features.
