I am Kunjan (_a.k.a. Kunjee for friends and tweeps_). Failed poet, mathematics enthusiast, functional programming evangelist, and software architecture expert with 17+ years of industry experience.

> Partially natural ambidextrous, a proper south paw and a true Sagittarius.

I am the Founder of [Fuzzy Cloud](https://fuzzycloud.in/), a frequent conference speaker, and an active OSS Contributor. I maintain several open source projects including [awesome-fable](https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable) and contribute to various Rust ecosystem projects like actix and juniper. My expertise spans mobile, web, and cloud technologies, with a particular focus on Functional Programming, WebAssembly, and modern web frameworks.

Currently seeking roles as Principal Software Engineer, Software Architect, or CTO positions where I can leverage my extensive experience in building scalable, maintainable systems using modern technologies.
