When heart beat for you,   
When eyes get wet for you,   
You were there   
But you never understand   

It’s not that you don’t know   
But you always say it’s NO   
You know it all   
But you never understand   
 
Every word sought for you   
Every line sings for you   
You read it all   
But you never understand   

It’s not that you don’t know   
It’s not that you don’t feel   
You know it all, you feel it all   
But you never understand   

I smile because of you    
I weep just for you   
What more can I say, I live just for you   
But you never understand   

Every time I asked you said NO   
Every time it’s NO, just NO   
For everything I asked you said NO   
Every time it’s NO, nothing but NO   
But I never understand   

You should ask the moon, he knows it all   
You should ask the stars, they know it all   
I’m awake all night, in memory of you   
But you never understand   

It’s not that you have no one else   
But it is that I don’t want anyone else   
But you never understand   

Now the only thing left is   
NO, nothing but NO, just a dry NO   
Still I am searching for that one YES   
But you never understand
