First friend I found was you   
First enemy I found was you   
First fight I had was with you   
First person I always miss is you   
I miss you, my dear sister

Beating me was your favorite game   
Teasing me with different names   
Remaining is now, only the pain   
Not being with you, I feel mundane   
I miss you, my dear sister
 
You are Dad’s favorite   
You are Mom’s favorite   
But you know you are also my favorite   
Then why you became someone else’s favorite   
I miss you, my dear sister  

Achievements are just made for you   
Success always waiting for you   
Even world is following you   
But you know at home, someone still waiting for you   
I miss you, my dear sister   
 
You went to school made new friends   
You went to college made new friends   
I go to school, you are my friend   
I go to college, you are my friend   
I miss you, my dear sister

I know you want to shine and never fade   
Want to study and always be ahead   
Want to work hard and move forward   
But once look back, and then move forward   
I miss you, my dear sister


Time doesn’t stop, neither do you   
You are busy with time for only few   
I am still at doorstep, eagerly waiting for you   
I miss you, my dear sister

You got married, had a new life   
Few more smiles because of you,   
A new sunrise shines your new life   
But what will I do without you   
I miss you, my dear sister

My life is incomplete without you   
My poem is incomplete without you
