Its wonderful morning  
Sun is waiting to rise  
It’s waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your wonderful smile  

Birds wake up  
Songs are waiting to be sung  
Beats are waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your dazzling smile  
 
Air just started moving   
Breeze just wanted to spread   
Fragrance is waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your mesmerizing smile   

Pen is ready to write   
Ink is desperate to draw   
Poem is waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your poetic smile  

My heart just wants to beat  
Breath is waiting for you sun shine   
Waiting for your lovely smile  

It’s not that  
World is not having it all  
But nature is waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your beautiful smile  

Violin is with me  
I start playing  
But music is waiting for you sun shine  
Waiting for your musical smile  

Just break the ice  
Bind a spell  
Ohhh sun shine  
Waiting for your magical smile  

Just waiting for your smile  
Hey sun shine  
Waiting for your smile  
Ohhh sun shine  
Waiting for your smile
