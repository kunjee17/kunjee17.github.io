There is a continues war between typed and untyped data. But then there is need of finding a middle ground for ever growing application. There is place, a requirement when I feel application should be typed and data store should be untyped. So, I created this little code snippet to access cloudant (a couchbase fork) NOSQL database. 

 

I was knowing about [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com) from long back. Even before IBM bought it. It is indeed a wonderful service and also kinda free for small stuff. I thought this will be best fit for now. (I still don't know why I didn't use Mongodb). 

As there is no need of scary relations ships with database. So, I decided to use this one. 

Now as one problem is solved other started. It is saving data that is in JSON format. That is untyped and F# is statically typed. I have tried few libraries developed in C# but was not happy. So, I thought it is just a HTTP request, why shouldn't I give it as shot to make one of my own helper module? It is may be some what dirty attempt but I got it working what I needed with less than 100 lines. Here is code snippets.


    #r "../packages/Http.fs.1.4.0/lib/net40/HttpClient.dll"
    #r "../packages/Newtonsoft.Json.6.0.6/lib/net45/Newtonsoft.Json.dll"
    
    open HttpClient
    open Newtonsoft.Json
    open Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
    
    [<CLIMutableAttribute>]
    type Row<'a> = 
        { id : string
          key : string
          value : 'a }
    
    [<CLIMutableAttribute>]
    type ResultSet<'a> = 
        { total_rows : int
          offset : int
          rows : Row<'a> [] }
    
    [<CLIMutableAttribute>]
    type PostResult = 
        { ok : string
          id : string
          rev : string }
    
    [<CLIMutableAttribute>]
    type PostError = 
        { error : string
          reason : string }
    
    let cloudantUrl = @"<cloudanturl/databasename/>"
    let username = @"<username>"
    let password = @"<password>"
    
    let private cloudantGet url = 
        let request = 
            createRequest Get url
            |> withBasicAuthentication username password
            |> withHeader (ContentType "application/json")
        request |> getResponseBody
    
    let private cloudantPost url data = 
        let request = 
            createRequest Post url
            |> withBasicAuthentication username password
            |> withBody data
            |> withHeader (ContentType "application/json")
        request |> getResponseBody
    
    let private checkDataForNewId (data : JObject) = 
        let removeIdrev (data : JObject) = 
            data.Remove("_id") |> ignore
            data.Remove("_rev") |> ignore
        if System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(data.["_id"].ToString()) || System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(data.["_rev"].ToString()) then 
            removeIdrev data
        data
    
    let PostJson<'a> data = 
        let serializedObject = JObject.FromObject(data) |> checkDataForNewId
        serializedObject.Add("$doctype", JToken.Parse("'" + data.GetType().Name + "'"))
        cloudantPost cloudantUrl <| serializedObject.ToString()
    
    let GetJsonByType<'a> = 
        let resultset = 
            JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ResultSet<'a>>
                (cloudantGet (cloudantUrl + "/_design/Type/_view/" + typeof<'a>.Name))
        query { 
            for row in resultset.rows do
                select row.value
        }
    
    let GetJsonById<'a> Id = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<'a>(cloudantGet (cloudantUrl + Id))
    
    [<CLIMutableAttribute>]
    type Person = 
        { _id : string
          _rev : string
          FirstName : string
          LastName : string }
    
    let newPerson = 
        { _id = ""
          _rev = ""
          FirstName = "Boom"
          LastName = "Baam" }
    
    let inline isNull (x:^a when ^a : not struct) =
        obj.ReferenceEquals (x, Unchecked.defaultof<_>)
    
    let findPerson = 
        query { 
            for p in GetJsonByType<Person> do
                where (p.FirstName = "Boom")
                select p
                headOrDefault
                }
    isNull findPerson    
    GetJsonById<Person> ("3b389dc6b8ee0dcbf7f366faaa59cf42")

In above code below part is just for testing. And even with that code snippet is 98 lines. So, with blank line removed it is even short. 

Now, in cloudant I need to create views so its code is like 

    function(doc) {
        if (doc.$doctype !== "Person") return;
        var copydoc = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(doc));
        delete copydoc["$doctype"];
        emit(doc._id,copydoc);
    }

I need `$doctype` while I am inserting or updating data only, not while reading. So, I am removing it. As I am already filtering based on type.

In above code two libraries are getting used one is [Http.fs](https://github.com/relentless/Http.fs) and the other is [JSON.net](http://james.newtonking.com/json) libraries. 

In library as you can see I am not doing anything special. I am inserting data with type information. If new data is there I am removing `_id` and `_rev` and for simplicity sake I had put `_id` and `_rev` in all the types I am using to interacting with Cloudant data store. 

So, now whenever I am reading I just need to give type and that will be fetched as collection of that typed records. And once collection came to memory now I have powerful F# to process data. In above code I am using `query` expression to do so. It becomes very easy and fun to use. And it is damn fast. At least for now.

Now, I don't know it if perfect or not. It kinda part functional and part Object Oriented as far as I know. Should I convert this to Type Provider or is it possible or not? I don't know. But one thing is sure I am achieving what I wanted with simplest possible code. 

**Dear F# community members** do provide your views on this. And also let me know if it will be use full to make it more mature and push it as nuget package. Or may be a type provider for Cloudant?
