I am not much a writer kind of person. If you drop a math puzzle, probably I will do it in better way. But sometimes it is necessity to do thing even though you are not good at it. Just like this Open Letter. [Tekpub][1] is wonderful endeavor from [Rob Conery][2] and one of his friend [James Avery][3] . I know [Tekpub][1] because of [Rob Conery][2] .

You can consider me in his fan club, if he is having one. I don’t know of it yet.

> Hey, Rob. Do you have any fan club like thing ??? I really like to join one.

Here in India, every other teacher expect student to be like [Arjuna][4] , because of his concentration and dedication towards the learning or work. But the person they forget is [Ekalavya][5] . And Rob sir is providing that opportunity to world to learn like [Ekalavya][5] . Learning from distance and prove your worthy.

[Tekpub][1] is having open house for a weekend. And first thing I have done is watching a video of a programming wizard, genius developer and classic speaker [Scott Hanselman][6] . I was waiting for this from a long time. Actually I am saving money to buy at least this video, because here we have currency in rupees and conversion to dollar is bit heavy on pocket. No doubt I am earning fair enough as software engineer but still amount is a more in terms of rupees.

These are not the only thing, I am currently checking out few more screen casts. And they are awesome. I always in favor of knowledge sharing. And may be this is the only reason to have a dream to work in Microsoft. Money obviously matters, but that I can earn it any how. At the end of the day I am from [Gujarat][7] . But knowledge, learning new things and specially having fun at what I do; will be possible at few places only. It is not about Microsoft but about persons like [Scott Hanselman][6] , [Phil Haack][8] , [Rob Conery][2] and others. Working with them is seriously a fun stuff, its like you are learning from a university and also getting paid for that.

> Hey, Scott Sir. In any case you are reading this. Please Please do take care of your self. At least buy me some time so I can meet you in person someday in future. Diabetes called as “Rajarog” in India. Means it only comes to king and/or it is king of all diseases as it provide wonderful platform for other diseases to have dance off. So, please do take care and keep on talking. I never miss your screen cast or talk.

I seriously like to thank Rob and Team for bringing up such a wonderful world of knowledge. And also having open pass to access them on weekend. Keep on the good work.

I seriously recommended that wasting time for some box office flicks, better enjoy heroes from Technology world.

Thanks of Open House at [Tekpub][1] . And thanks to [pluralsight][9] 

Sincerely,

Kunjan
