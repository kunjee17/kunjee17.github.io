When sun starts to rise   
When sun shine enlightens me   
I miss your shining smile   
I miss you

Journey of life just restarted   
Roads just started to shine   
But I miss your hand in my hand   
I miss you

With every rhythm of song   
With every strum of guitar   
I miss your words   
I miss you

Started to write poem   
But lines just started crying   
Words are missing letters   
And I miss you

I just want to move on   
But heart still waiting for you   
My heart missing beats for you   
I miss you

Noise of crowd surrounds me   
But your silence still hurts me   
Break the silence, spark the words   
I miss you, I miss your voice

Feeling emptiness in middle of life   
Either come and meet me   
Or gift me death   
I miss you, I miss you so much


My words are not enough for you   
[You still don’t understand][5] a bit   
But still I will write for you   
Because I miss you… I miss you so much…;
