 कुर्क्षेत्र की युद्ध भूमि पर सैन्य निरिक्षण 


Its all started when war of Mahabharata is about to begin. Both army stand against each other. And at the time of war, [Arjuna][1] told [Krishna][2] to take his chariot to the middle of battle field. When they reach there, [Arjuna][1] observed both side of army.

At this time he found only relatives on the both side. And he just collapsed. He don’t want to fight. He don’t want to win at the cost of killing his own relatives. He asked [Krishna][2] 
<!--excerpt-->
 > What is significant of this type of win? Why should I win? Why should I do the war?
 
At that time Krishna recite Gita. Other than [Arjuna][1] there are few others who heard Gita, one is [Hanuman][3] who is there in the flag of [Arjuna’s][1] chariot. And other is [Sanjay][4] who has “divya drashti”.


So, here by I try to explain every “slok” of Gita.


I pray to [Shree Ganesh][5] as there is a tradition that every good thing start with the name of [Shree Ganesh][5] .
