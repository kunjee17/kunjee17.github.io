## Duration 

It is a 2 Days hands-on workshop. It would be minimum PPT and maximum real-world coding.


## Overview

This workshop is perfect for beginners who want to dive into the world of React - taught by someone who's been there since React took its first steps! With 17+ years of web development experience and having witnessed React's evolution from its inception, you'll learn from real-world experience, not just PowerPoint slides copied from the internet *(yes, we've all sat through those presentations where the trainer is learning along with you* ).

By the end of this training, you'll have the skills to create your own React projects and confidently work with React's foundational features - backed by practical insights from years of production experience.
